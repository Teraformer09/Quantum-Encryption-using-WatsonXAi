Project: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with BB84 Protocol
Overview
This project aims to implement a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system using the BB84 protocol. QKD provides unconditional security by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, making it a promising solution for secure communication in the face of increasing cyber threats.
Key Features
 * Quantum Circuit Simulation: Utilizes Qiskit to simulate quantum circuits representing the BB84 protocol.
 * Key Generation: Generates a shared secret key between two parties using the BB84 protocol.
 * Security Analysis: Evaluates the security of the generated key against potential eavesdropping attacks.
 * Integration with IBM Watsonx AI: Leverages Watsonx AI for data analysis, machine learning, and potential optimization of quantum circuits.
Project Structure
 * quantum_circuit.py: Contains the Qiskit code for creating and simulating the BB84 quantum circuit.
 * data_generation.py: Generates synthetic data for training and testing machine learning models.
 * machine_learning.py: Implements machine learning models (e.g., using Watsonx AI) for tasks like key generation prediction or circuit optimization.
 * security_analysis.py: Contains functions for analyzing the security of the generated key against potential attacks.
Installation
 * Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
